I'm going to give you a scientific paper to read.  I want you to do one very simple thing as you read that paper:  I want you to imagine what style of music would best be represented by this paper.  A weird request to be sure, so you'll need to flex your creativity.  As you read, try to hear the music in your head.

Ok, here is the paper.
