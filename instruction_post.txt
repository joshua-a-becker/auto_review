Now, having read that paper and thought about music, I want you to give the style of the song that this paper would be.   E.g. rock, opera, punk, broadway, jazz, shoegaze, ragtime, whatever.

Explain and justify your answer very briefly, linking the content of the paper to the music genre choice.  Note:  you should not consider the writing style or the journal style.  Just the actual scientific .content, the subject under discussion

Give your response as JSON, please, just a simple object containing the format {genre: <your answer>, explanation: <your answer>}
